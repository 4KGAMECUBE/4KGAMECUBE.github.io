<h1 class="underline">Favourite Stuff</h1>

<div>


   <h3>Panzer Dragoon Saga</h3>
   <p>
   This is the most expensive game I have purchased and it is also my favourite game. <br>I really think everyone should play this game, not because it is rare and expensive but because it is so ahead of it's time and unique </p>

      <div class="favimg">

     </div>

   <h3>EarthBound</h3>
   <p>
   I wanted to own this for about 9 years though and honestly I have no regrets. <br>
   Love this game and it is one of my most prized possesions.</p>

      <div class="favimg">
         <img src="/favs/eb.jpg"></a>
     </div>

   <h3>Chibi Robo</h3>
   <p>Someone was selling this game on ebay for &pound40 because it wouldn't work. <br>I bought it and it played just fine because it was just an NTSC copy and the seller did not know.<br>
      The disc is in perfect condition and it has the manual and box and everything. <br>This is one of the best deals I ever got when collecting.<br></p>

      <div class="favimg">
        <img src="/favs/chibirobo.jpg"></a>
     </div>

   <h3>Virtual Boy Wario Land</h3>
   <p>I got this on eBay for about &pound250 and it was sold as just the console... <br>A few weeks later a huge Fedex package arrived with a VB 
      in the box with 2 controllers and 2 games... <br>Holy shit.<br></p>

   <div class="favimg">
      <img src="/favs/vb.jpg"></a>
  </div>
   
   <h3>Splatoon</h3>
   <p>This is the game that got me involved in my first online communities and it means a lot to me because of that. <br>It isn't rare or anything but this is definitely one of my
      favourite games I own.<br></p>

      <div class="favimg">
        <img src="/favs/splatoon.jpg"></a>
     </div>
   
    <h3>Mother series</h3>
   <p> I wanted to own all the main games and it was so cool to finally do that. The Mother series is my second favourite gaming franchise, just behind Pikmin<br></p>

   <div class="favimg">
      <img src="/favs/mothers.jpg"></a>
  </div>
  
      <h3>Mario RPG games</h3>
   <p>The Mario rpg games are so much fun, especially the early ones. <br>A lot of these games are also very expensive and I am happy to own these. I have the newer ones too but I am not too fond of them. <br>Unfortunately my Paper Mario has a fake label but at least it does have a genuine PCB!<br></p>

   <div class="favimg">
      <img src="/favs/rpg.jpg"></a>
  </div>

   <h3>Cave Story</h3>
   <p>Fantastic game that I am very happy to own physically.<br> 4 times... and many more times digitally...<br></p>

   <div class="favimg">
     <img src="/favs/cavestory.jpg"></a>
  </div>

   <h3>Futurama</h3>
   <p>One of the rarer Xbox games and I even have the rare purple cover.<br> Just bought a standard copy from CEX and got sent the rarer variation!<br></p>

   <div class="favimg">
      <img src="/favs/futurama.jpg"></a>
  </div>

    <h3>LR Games</h3>
   <p>Some of my favourite indie games. LR games suck but still! They are cool!<br></p>

   <div class="favimg">
     <img src="/favs/celeste.jpg"></a>
  </div>

   <h3>Mario Kart Super Circuit</h3>
   <p>The only game I ever bought at a convention. Was a very fun experience :)<br></p>

   <div class="favimg">
      <img src="/favs/mksc.jpg"></a>
  </div>

   <h3>Mario Galaxy</h3>
   <p>Childhood favourite. This game is everything to me. <br>I got the American copy while visiting Canada. Both copies are very special to me.<br></p>

   <div class="favimg">
     <img src="/favs/mariogalaxy.jpg"></a>
  </div>
  
     <h3>Xenoblade Chronicles</h3>
   <p>Two of the best games I have played<br></p>

   <div class="favimg">
      <img src="/favs/xeno.jpg"></a>
  </div>

   <h3>Vib Ribbon</h3>
   <p>This game is so cool! You can put any CD into the Playstation and play any song. <br>My favourite thing to do is put in a Sega Saturn disc and play the soundtrack of one of those games.<br></p>

   <div class="favimg">
      <img src="/favs/vib.jpg"></a>
  </div>

 <h3>Katamari Damacy</h3>
 <p>This was the reason I bought a PS2. <br>Before this game I only really played on Nintendo consoles but this game made me branch out a bit and I am very glad I did.<br></p>

 <div class="favimg">
    <img src="/favs/katamari.jpg"></a>
</div>

<h3>Pikmin 2</h3>
<p>Pikmin 2 is a very special game to me. <br>I played it during one of the worst moments of my life and I really feel like it gave me something to look forward to doing while going through a lot of trauma.<br></p>

<div class="favimg">
   <img src="/favs/pikmin.jpg"></a>
</div>

<h3>Zelda game series</h3>
<p>Full mainline Zelda games. So many great games here<br></p>

<div class="favimg">
  <img src="/favs/zelda.jpg"></a>
</div>

<h3>Mario Kart Wii</h3>
<p>I met so many people through this game. So many friends that I still talk to today! (Hello Gui)<br></p>

<div class="favimg">
   <img src="/favs/mkwii.jpg"></a>
</div>

   <h3>Everdrives</h3>
   <p>The best flash carts available. Some of the best investments I ever made into my collection.<br></p>

   <div class="favimg">
      <img src="/favs/everdrive.jpg"></a>
  </div>

   <h3>Wowaka - Unhappy Refrain</h3>
   <p>This is my favourite album from my favourite music artist. I feel very privileged to own a copy considering Wowaka's death.<br></p>

   <div class="favimg">
      <img src="/favs/unhappy.jpg"></a>
  </div>


  <h3>ABBA Stuff</h3>
  <p>Love ABBA. Need more of their music physical. My favourite one is the ABBA Gold VCD<br></p>

  <div class="favimg">
     <img src="/favs/abba.jpg"></a>
 </div>

   <h3>Panasonic Q + HDMI Modded Gamecube + Tales of Symphonia Gamecube</h3>
   <p>Bought this as broken. It just works though after a little bit of wiggling with the drive, the grease must have just hardened over time but now it is completely fine.<br>
       It plays Gamecube games and VCD (I don't own any Japanese DVDS). <br>I also have a HDMI modded cube and a rare Tales of Symphonia edition console which I really love :)<br></p>

   <div class="favimg">
      <img src="/favs/gamecube.jpg"></a>
  </div>

   <h3>Gamecube Keyboard Controller + Other rare Gamecube controllers.</h3>
   <p>I spent way too much money on this, I just had to own one. I also collect other rare Gamecube controllers. <br>These are some of my favourites.<br></p>

   <div class="favimg">
      <img src="/favs/gccontroller.jpg"></a>
  </div>

   <h3>Sound Voltex Controller</h3>
   <p>My favourite game controller. I spent the extra money on Sanwa buttons after enjoying SDVX so much. I'm not very good at it but it is still fun!<br></p>

   <div class="favimg">
      <img src="/favs/faucetwo.jpg"></a>
  </div>

   <h3>Hori N64 and Gamecube controllers</h3>
   <p>Hori controllers are always great. These are two of the best.<br></p>

   <div class="favimg">
      <img src="/favs/hori.jpg"></a>
  </div>

   <h3>Sega Saturn</h3>
   <p>I love this console and to show it off to people. <br>I like the way games look on this console and the 3D controller is so fun to use. Probably the most interesting video game system to me honestly</p>

   <div class="favimg">
      <img src="/favs/saturn.jpg"></a>
  </div>

   <h3>Super Nintendo</h3>
   <p>One of my favourite consoles. The USA Snes looks ugly. I can't be bothered to take a new picture with my Super Famicom JR haha<br></p>

   <div class="favimg">
      <img src="/favs/snes.jpg"></a>
  </div>

  <h3>Vive Devkit</h3>
  <p>My cool Vive Devkit<br></p>

  <div class="favimg">
     <img src="/favs/devkit.jpg"></a>
 </div>

   <h3>Pimax 8KX</h3>
   <p>The best VR headset.<br></p>

   <div class="favimg">
      <img src="/favs/pimax.jpg"></a>
  </div>

   <h3>HTC Vive Pro Eye</h3>
   <p>Wireless VR is amazing. I even sometimes use this over my Pimax just for the wireless and especially the eye tracking.<br></p>
